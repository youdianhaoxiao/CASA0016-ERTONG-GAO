# CASA0016 DIY Indoor automatic humidifier

## Motivation
Statistics show that people spend more than 90 per cent of their time indoors. Keeping the air humid helps some people with dry skin and also requires special attention to their respiratory health. Dry environments not only cause dry skin, but also respiratory-related illnesses. Especially the elderly, it is very important for them to keep their skin moisturised, but many of them, do not have the awareness and do not know how to use some of the advanced devices, therefore, automatic humidifiers play an important role as an effective respiratory protection device for the health of some people with dry skin.

## Aim
Construct a device that collects external temperature and humidity data, then displays the data on the LCD screen and shows different indicators according to different humidity levels, and then automatically determines whether humidification is required for different humidity data and automatically humidifies the device.
LED indicator corresponding to the humidity: (1) When the humidity is less than 50%, then the LED lights red. (2) When the humidity is between 50% and 60%, the LED lights green. (3) When the humidity is greater than 60% (here is must be greater than 60% instead of greater than or equal to), the LED lights blue.
Humidification condition judgement: when the temperature is less than 50% of the humidifier began to work automatically, until the humidity is greater than 60%, the humidifier will automatically stop working.

Neopixel strip

Here we only use a lamp as an indicator, the follow-up we expect to use the lamp belt to make a more fun effect of the lamp belt, for subsequent upgrades can also be added to more lights to achieve a number of different effects, the lamp belt for our upgrades to do the next pad, for example, we follow up to add two humidifier driver module to increase the effect of humidification, the humidity is lower than 50% to start the two humidifiers, higher than 50% to start a If the humidity is lower than 40%, the three humidifiers will be turned on together, so that we can use the back of the strip to indicate the working status of each humidifier, orange represents the corresponding humidifier is in the working state, and purple represents that the humidifier is in the off state, and the humidifier is in the off state, and the humidifier is in the off state.

#### Outer Case

I used 3d printer to print the LCD holder and neopixel holder,and attached those two on the top of the sensor container.

The humidifier container was made from laser printing, and I did not use a 3D printed proper enclosure because I thought laser printing was less time-consuming. I punched holes in the laser printed template so that the sensor could sense the outside air and the power cord could stick out.

#### DHT22 Humidity and Temperature
The human body is comfortable with humidity levels between 40% and 60%, so the neopixel displays a red LED if the humidity in the room is less than 50%, a green LED if the humidity in the room is more than 50% and less than 60%, and Greater than 60% will be shown in blue LED.

#### relay (electronics)
The reason I use a relay here is to control the humidifier on/off，
The relay is used to determine whether to energise the humidifier by judging the high and low potential, when pin4 feeds back to the relay a high potential (corresponding to humidity less than 50%), the relay starts to work and energise the humidifier, when pin4 feeds back a low potential (corresponding to humidity greater than 60%), the relay breaks the circuit, and the humidifier will stop working.

#### Humidifier Driver Circuit
I use the principle of humidifier module is to use piezoelectric ceramic atomising sheet to produce high frequency resonance, the water into can float 1-5um tiny mist particles, and then catalytic dispersal into the air, and then cotton swabs role is to carry on the water absorption.

#### External power supply
I made a simple external power supply by taking a piece of copper wire and cutting a usb cable short, and proceeded to power the humidifier driver module, because the Arduino uno power supply is weak, so an external power supply is used for powering it.

* Add a remote control or mobile app to control the humidifier.
* Add more atomiser driver modules for faster humidification.
